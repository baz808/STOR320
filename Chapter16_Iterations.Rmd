*** For Loops

```{r}
df = tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)
df
```

```{r}
output = vector("double", ncol(df)) # output

for (i in seq_along(df)) {          # sequence
  output[[i]] = median(df[[i]])     # body
}

output
```

* Output --> 'output = vector("double", length(x))'
- allocating space for the output
- 'vector(arg1 = type of vector, arg2 = length of vector)' 

* Sequence --> 'i in seq_along(df)' 
- determines what to loop over, assigns i to different value from 'seq_along(df)' 
- 'seq_along(arg1 = df)'

* Body --> 'output[[i]] = median(df[[i]])'
- loops over values in the vector
